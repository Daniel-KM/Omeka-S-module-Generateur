Generateur (module for Omeka S)
===============================

This module is currently a work in progress.


[Generateur] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows users to create a text and to
generate fake new texts from it. This module is built for the project Polemika
of Université Paris 8 Diderot and is designed to help students to learn to
exercise good judgment on the news.

The algorithm to build generations of texts is available as a [script] too.

**IMPORTANT**: This algorithm is not yet included.


Installation
------------

First, install the optional module [Generic].

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder `Generateur`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module] and follow the
config instructions.


Displaying Generation
---------------------

The generations are a new type of resource. They are available as a menu in the
admin menu and as a tab in each item.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitHub.
